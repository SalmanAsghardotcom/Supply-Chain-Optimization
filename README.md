# Supply Chain Optimization Project

This project focuses on optimizing the supply chain for a car dealership using forecasting and optimization techniques. The project includes data analysis, forecasting future demand, and optimizing inventory levels.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to improve the efficiency of the supply chain by accurately forecasting demand and optimizing inventory levels. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, forecasting using the ARIMA model, and inventory optimization.

## Files in this Repository

- **supply_chain_optimization.py**: Python script for data preprocessing, forecasting, and optimization.
- **forecast_results.csv**: CSV file containing forecasted demand values.
- **optimization_results_advanced.csv**: CSV file containing optimization results.
- **Supply_Chain_Optimization_Dashboard.twbx**: Tableau workbook with visualizations of the forecast and optimization results.
- **Supply_Chain_Optimization_Report.docx**: Detailed report of the project.

## Instructions

1. **Python Script**: Run the `supply_chain_optimization.py` script to generate the `forecast_results.csv` and `optimization_results_advanced.csv` files.
2. **Tableau Dashboard**: Open the `Supply_Chain_Optimization_Dashboard.twbx` file in Tableau to view the visualizations.
3. **PDF Report**: Read the `Supply_Chain_Optimization_Report.docx` for a detailed overview of the project.
